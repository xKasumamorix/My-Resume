<h2>Passions</h2><hr />

<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p>My passion for video games stems from growing up immersed in them. From an early age, they weren’t just entertainment for me—they were a way to explore new worlds, challenge myself, and connect with others. Over the years, my love for gaming has only grown stronger, and it continues to shape the way I think, create, and interact with the world around me.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Music has always been a big part of my life. Growing up, it was more than just something to listen to—it became a way for me to express myself. I started playing guitar, and it’s become a huge outlet for creativity and personal connection. I’m also passionate about drums, and it’s something I dream of learning one day. Music has this unique ability to connect with people, and it continues to inspire me in countless ways.</p><hr />
